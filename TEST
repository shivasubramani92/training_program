Task 1.​ What is Linux​? Explain 5 linux​ commands.
--------------------------------------------------


Linux is like a unix.linux is a open source operating systems for computres,mobiles,server and embedded devices.
linux supports on major computer platforms.linux is one of the most widely used paltform


Example:
--------
 cd,ls,mkdir,rmdir,pwd,cat,append,


Task 2.​ Define Linux Kernel​?
----------------------------
linux kernal is a computer program and its core of the operating systems.
kernal is used known the Operating system version, hostname.


Task 3.​ What is the difference between 32bit​ and 64bit​ computers? How much
maximum memory access​ they can have?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

32 bit computer
----------------                       

32 bit computer refers the computer processor also called Central Processing Unit
32 bit computers handle the huge amount of randaom access memory
32 bit is defined by 2^32



64 bit computer
---------------

64 bit computer refers the computer processor also called central processing unit CPU
64 bit computers handle the large amount of random access memory
64 bit is defined by 2^64

maximum memory access is 2^256


Task 4.​ What is git​ 
-------------------

git is a one of the open source database. git is available in version 2.0.
git can be share the data in single user or multiple users such as team participant
git can be used to share the data between the users

what version​ installed in your Linux machine
--------------------------------------------
git version 2.7.4


6.​ What is low level language​ and high level language​? Give examples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

high level languages will be converted into a machine readble form by a compiler or interprter.
high lvel languages required more spaces.
high level languages are non compact
high level languages are easy to write as well as compile

example 
-------

class square
 {
flaot r1 = b
float r2 = h
float surface ()
return b*h/6
}
 

low level language is machine readble form of program
low level languages required less space
lo level languages are compact.
low level language are difficult to write and compile 

example 
---------

load  r1,b
load r2,h
mul r1*r2
div r2,#r1

Task 7.​ Define object​ in the context of object oriented programming​. Give
code example​ in any object oriented language.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Oriented Programming language is a high level programming language based on Object Oriented Programming(OOP) model.

syntax 
-------

circle testObject = new circle();

class Circle 
{         
private:
   double radius;      
public:   
   double getRadius(); 
   double getArea();
}


Task 8.​ Write a python code​ to print your linux distribution​ name and kernel
version.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

import sys
print ("python version")
print (sys.version)
print ("version info.")
print (sys.version_info)



Task 9.​ Write a python​ code using function, file input ​and print​ each line with line number​ in the terminal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
} 
print(thisdict)
print(len(thisdict()))
print 

Task 10.​ Write a python​ code using class​ (at least 3 functions inside) and dictionary.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
